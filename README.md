Gesture-Based Presentation Controller
Description
An innovative project designed to make presentations seamless and hands-free using hand gestures. This application leverages computer vision and gesture recognition technology to navigate slides, zoom in/out, and control the slideshow.

Features
Navigate Left/Right: Use hand gestures to move between slides.
Zoom In/Out: Control zoom using two-finger gestures.
Start/Stop Presentation: Start or exit the slideshow with a thumbs-up gesture.
Integrated Camera Feed: Displays a real-time camera feed for screen recordings.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
OpenCV: For computer vision.
Mediapipe: For gesture recognition.
PyAutoGUI: To control keyboard actions programmatically.
How It Works
Gesture Detection: The system detects hand gestures using Mediapipe.
Action Mapping: Each gesture is mapped to a specific keyboard action.
Real-Time Camera Feed: The feed is displayed for user convenience during screen recordings.
